		<h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
		<p>la&middot;Galerie was established to provide opportunities to artists entering the global art market.

		He has worked closely with his roster of artists, some for more than 25 years, to help fulfill their ambitious dreams and projects. 		
		The gallery is frequented by art lovers looking to find and buy original artwork.

		<h2>THE EARLY YEARS</h2>
    	<p class="year">1989 - 2014</p>
    	<p>Emmanuel Partinu founded his first gallery in 1989 at the age of 21. He has since opened over 17 different spaces with the aim to continue offering 
    	increasingly vibrant and creative environments to experience artists’ works. He has worked closely with his roster of artists, some for more than 25 years, 
    	to help fulfill their ambitious dreams and projects.<br/> 
    	Inaugurated in 2005 in an 18th century mansion and expanding two years later into the space next door, la&middot;Galerie has continued to add to his three gallery spaces 
    	(approx. 1600 sq. meters) in the Marais district of Paris. In 2014, la&middot;Galerie opened a 700 sq. meter showroom up the street from the gallery known as La Salle de Bal, 
    	a former Ballroom in the Hôtel d’Ecquevilly named “du Grand Veneur”, a 17th century Hôtel Particulier. In its entirety, the Parisian spaces amount to approximately 
    	2300 sq. meters.
