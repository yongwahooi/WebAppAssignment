            <h3>Synopsis</h3>
            <p>The pieces presented in the ‘Through Rose-Tinted Glasses’ exhibition refer to both personal and social issues that are significant to the artists’ lives. However, instead of simply criticizing the realities, these artists are challenged to look at the conditions with optimism – to apply a positive angle that could even expand to finding a solution. They have highlighted something that has affected them, in the hope showing the viewers a new perspective on the issue at hand – a fresher way of looking at the world and coping with its complexities.</p>
